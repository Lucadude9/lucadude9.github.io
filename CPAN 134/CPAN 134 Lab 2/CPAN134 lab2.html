                    <p>
                        Lots of beef but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera
                        version showing the personalities of <br>the players rather than dealing with the nuts
                        and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but <br>the movie
                        tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying tot do the right thing.

                        I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of
                        capitalists could royally screw their <br>families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen
                        and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.
