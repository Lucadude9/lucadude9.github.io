Project Topic
Pop culture: reviews and discussions
Project Scope
To create a website in which users are able to discuss with others online the following topics:
video games, comic, novels, music, movies, and tv shows. We want to create a safe space
where the sole purpose is for people to find others with similar interests to create discussions
and review media within pop culture. We would like for our website to have different categories
based on what the user would like to discuss and get off their mind on their trip to our website.
List of features
- Home page with icons(links) to separate parts of the website depending on what topic
they would like to discuss or review products of media
- Each category will have a generalized discussion area
- Then there will be sub categories which will include a more specific piece of media for
example a certain movie
- Then inside the sub category there will be a overall review along with what each
individual review a user gave the movie and people are able to comment on that review
- Also inside of the sub category there will be general reviews about that specific piece of
media where anyone can add their piece of thoughts to create discussions
- Engagement between other users with ability to upvote or downvote someone's
discussion or review so users can see top reviews or discussions
- We would like the ability for the user to have their own profile so they can have their own
username
- We would like to have a clean and user friendly interface

- When on the topic of the specific piece of media there will be the ability of how to find
that piece of media including links to its source
- Ability to save bookmarks
- Ability to filter results like most upvoted or most commented
